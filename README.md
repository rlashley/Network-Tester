# Network-Tester
Creating a small networking tool using C#

This tool will have features slowly added to it over time. Networking has always been one of the more interesting aspects of computing
to me and I'd like to dive deeper into what the System.Net library contains, as well as get better using tools such as Visual Studio,
Git, and C# in general.

I may add UML sketches up here eventually in order to better focus my ideas in a direction, before the app gets too unwieldy.

I'd also like to add some concepts into my code that I should probably practice with, such as testing, partial classes, and utilization
of more Interfaces.

I'm glad to take on suggestions for my project, just let me know!
